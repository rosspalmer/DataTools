{"name":"Datatools","tagline":"Data Manipulation and Analysis Tools","body":"#DataTools\r\n\r\n> v0.1.2\r\n\r\nThe purpose of DataTools is to create a single platform to host many Python data analytics modules (Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, etc) within a standardized structure. We want to provide the end user with ability to experiment with several analytics techniques quickly without having to spend time coding for the needs of a particular analytics module.\r\n\r\nDataTools is also designed to automatically regulate the flow of data between the modules as well as provide compatibility with many different data platforms, such as SQL, Excel/CSV files, and pandas.\r\n\r\n#Features\r\n\r\n##Supported Statistical Models\r\n\r\n- Simple/Multiple Linear - `linear`\r\n- Logistic Regression - `logistic`\r\n- K-Means Clustering - `kmeans`\r\n- K-Means Classification - `knearest`\r\n\r\n###Planned Models\r\n\r\n- Discriminate Analysis\r\n- Additional GLS Methods\r\n- Weighted Regression Models\r\n- Neural Networks\r\n- Classification Trees\r\n- Support Vector Machines\r\n\r\n##Supported I/O Data Platforms\r\n\r\n- CSV Files\r\n- SQL\r\n    - sqlite\r\n    - MySQL\r\n    - More flavors to come\r\n\r\n###Planned I/O Platfroms\r\n\r\n- Excel Files\r\n- JSON\r\n- XML\r\n- External pandas DataFrames\r\n\r\n##Additional Planned Features\r\n\r\n- Randomized data partitioning\r\n- Validation testing\r\n- Automatic categorical variable conversion\r\n- Variable choice optimization for models\r\n\r\n#Installation\r\n\r\nDataTools is currently only available via a source distribution install. PyPi (pip) distributions will be added in the future.\r\n\r\n     git clone https://github.com/rosspalmer/DataTools.git\r\n     cd DataTools\r\n     python setup.py install\r\n\r\n#[Documentation](https://github.com/rosspalmer/DataTools/wiki/Documentation)\r\n\r\n#Quick Start Guide\r\n\r\nMost end user actions are accessed using the `manager` method. Below is a short tutorial on loading data from a CSV file, fitting a `linear` regression model on the data, and then outputing the results as a series of CSV files.\r\n\r\n_Note: Adding Tutorial_\r\n\r\n#External Analysis Modules\r\n\r\nAs I stated in the introduction paragraph, DataTools ultizes external Python modules for statistical modelling. Below are the modules responsible for **ALL** of the statistical modules used within DataTools.\r\n\r\n- [**StatsModels**](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/0.5.0/index.html)\r\n- [**scikit-learn**](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)\r\n\r\n#License\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2015 Ross Palmer\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
