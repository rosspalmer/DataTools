#DataTools

> v0.0.2

The purpose of DataTools is to create a single platform to host many available data analytics modules within 
a standardized structure. We want to provide the end user with ability to experiment with several
analytics techniques quickly without having to spending time coding for the needs of a particular analytics module.
DataTools will also offer SQL support to easily input or extract data from databases and run it through analytics models.
